<b>Stockionic</b> has two main functionalities:
<ul>
<li>Stock search and sort</li>
<li>Stock alerts</li>
</ul>
Both are based on <b>fundamental analysis features</b> of stocks.<br />
Note: the list of stocks is limited. To add more contact hectorlm1983@gmail.com.

<br /><br />
<b>Fundamental values used</b><br />
    <ul>
    <li>Value: current value of the stock</li>
    <li>Value change %: current % change of the stock</li>
    <li>PER: Price to earnings (P/E) ratio</li>
    <li>Yield: Anual dividend yield % and the number of dividends per year</li>
    <li>52 weeks value (heat): the current position in the 52 weeks value variation. E.g., ...</li>
    <li>52 weeks volatility: how much the value varied proportionally in 52 years. E.g., if you see 2x it means that the value doubled or shrinked to the half</li>
    <li>EPS diff: what % the EPS differed since last time it was reported</li>
    </ul>



<br /><br />
<b>Stock search and sort</b><br />
At the beginning you see a list of stocks. You can:
<ul>
<li>Search for stock symbols, tickers or names in the search bar</li>
<li>Sort the list using the buttons
    <ul>
    <li>YPR (used by default)</li>
    <li>PER, 2nd click EPS diff</li>
    <li>Yield</li>
    <li>52 weeks value, 2nd click reverse order, 3rd click volatility</li>
    <li>Alerts only: show only stocks for which you have alerts (see next section for more information)</li>
    </ul>


</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />
<b>Stock alerts (<ion-icon name="notifications"></ion-icon>)</b><br />
To add alerts you must click on the stock of your interest (e.g., GOOG).
A screen with only that stock will be opened and you will see some form input fields to add alerts.
You can add alerts for the cases where a value is lower or higher than what you want.
The values for which you can add alerts are:
<ul>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Value Change %</li>
<li>PER</li>
<li>Yield</li>
<li>EPS</li>
</ul>

When an alert fires you will receive an email and you will see the stock highlighted in red.
When you click on the alerts button you will see the stocks for which an alert has fired first.

<br /><br />
<b>How to use the app?</b><br />
Let's describe some use examples.
<ul>
<li>You want to invest in a stock but only when it reaches certain params</li>
<li>You don't know which stock to invest on. You want to see which ones could be better for you</li>
<li>You monitor stocks to decide when to sell</li>
</ul>
